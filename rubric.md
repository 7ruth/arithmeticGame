# Rubric

## Project Workflow

Performing- Really great planning. Awesome user stories and wireframes. I think it would be really great to include a readme to see how developers can contribute to/run this application.

## Technical Requirement

Performing - Really great job on this project. There are a lot of moving pieces. I would think about how we could refactor this code into using constructors. Very cool idea, well implemented.

## Code Quality

Excelling - Really great job commenting your code, very clear where you were trying to do things. There is.... a lot of white space. While this isn't a bad thing, I think it's worth mentioning that it does get to be a little clunky. I would recommend using tabs of 2 spaces to delineate code indentations and limiting to 1 new line between function definitions/blocks of code.

## Creativity/Interface
Excelling - Really creative first project! I really like the UI, although maybe the setup could be a bit more intuitive. It's very clean and well done!

Great job on this project Martin!
